# Hi! Welcome~
## <b>My name is Sherin Olivia</b> 

<p> This repository was prepared as part of the second weekly project involving flex, form, iframe, and responsive website in HTML & CSS! Wish me luck! <p>

### Deployed web : <a href="https://rooptnfanproject.netlify.app/#">Roo's PTN Fanproject</a>

<p>As mentioned, this weekly project also showcases my efforts (with major help from the internet and Team 2's TL) in expressing my tremendous respect and fondness for a mobile game called <b>Path to Nowhere<b></p>

<p>In the future, I hope to continuously update or remake this fanproject as the means to check and show my progress in my learning journey to become Software Engineer!</p>

### <b>A Preview!</b>
<img src="https://github.com/RevoU-FSSE-2/week-2-SherinOlivia/blob/main/images/ptnfanproject.jpeg" alt="Header's Web Capture!"/>

## <b>Featured :</b>
<ol>
<li>fixed nav bar~</li>
<li>functional nav links</li>
<li>grid layout for introductory photos</li>
<li>tid bits of animations in grid layout and Slideshow</li>
<li>Slideshow with amazing in-game pictures!</li>
<li>download links to apple store and google play store</li>
<li>minor details: favicon + unfunctional hamburger button for display</li>
</ol>

## <em><b>Initial Intention for Hamburger Button</em></b>
<p> When the button is clicked, there would be a sidebar that shows the functional nav links, with PTN's Dev/Publisher logo on the available space for extra credit coverage. It would also include some links to new upcoming characters and events and fixed links that directs viewers to PTN's official social media accounts!</p>

### <b>Compatibility!</b>
The deployed website has been tested in three different devices:
<ul>
<li>15.6" Windows Laptop(L)</li>
<li>14" Windows Laptop(S/M)</li>
<li>Android Phone (M)</li>
</ul>

##### Author's Note : Although the website has been tested across three different screen resolutions and gave back a good to satisfactory result, the level of comfort for each displayed component are purely subjective and heavily dependant on each visitor's eye health status as well. 
<p>Please be warned for possible seizure triggers as the contrast between the bright and darker colours may be triggering for some! Viewer discretion is heavily advised!</p>
