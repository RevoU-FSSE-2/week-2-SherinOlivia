# Hi! Welcome~
## My name is Sherin Olivia 

<p> This repository was prepared as part of the second weekly project involving flex, form, iframe, and responsive website in HTML & CSS! Wish me luck! <p>

### Deployed web : <a href="https://rooptnfanproject.netlify.app/#">Roo's PTN Fanproject</a>

<p>As mentioned, this weekly project also showcases my efforts (with major help from the internet and Team 2's TL) in expressing my tremendous respect and fondness for a mobile game called <b>Path to Nowhere<b></p>

<p>In the future, I hope to continuously update or remake this fanproject as the means to check and show my progress in my learning journey to become Software Engineer!</p>
